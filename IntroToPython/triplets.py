# Each triplet should be printed with both the numbers it contains and the indexes
# of these numbers in the original list.
# The program should also print the number of zero-sum triplets and its percentage from
# the total number of possible triplets.

# Example:
# ---- Numbers ----
# [38, -43, 16, -24, 20, -26, -36, -47, 20, -27]
# ---- Zero-sum triplets ----
# [ 2]:  16        + [ 4]:  20     + [ 6]: -36 = 0   
# [ 2]:  16        + [ 6]: -36     + [ 8]:  20 = 0   
# ---- Zero-sum triplets: 2 = 1.66% of 120.0
